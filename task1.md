SIT771 Object-Oriented Development 
Credit Task 1.4: Make a Scene! 
Focus 
Make the most of this task by focusing on the following: 
• Concepts: 
Focus on the idea of how code is structured and created as a sequence of actions. 
• Process:  
Consolidate your understanding of how to build and run custom-creative programs and use different 
libraries to achieve outcomes.  
Overview 
Now that you have grasped some of the key programming ideas related to objects, classes, methods, 
and sequences, you can start to use these to build more interesting programs. In this task, you will 
create a simple animation by creating a script that uses Window, Bitmap, and Sound Effect objects. 
Note: 
Remember that this is a Credit Tasks. Please make sure that you are up to date 
with the Pass Tasks before attempting this task. 
Submission Details 
For this task, you need to create a small animation program: something like showing a basic comic with 
the comics cells with some associated sound effects. 
Submit the following files to OnTrack. 
Your program code 
A screenshot of your program running 
The focus of this task is to give you a chance to be creative, while also practicing your programming 
skills. 
Instructions 
You should be able to create a simple animation by using Window, Bitmap, and SoundEffect objects. 
You can make a simple animation by crafting the sequence of actions the program performs. For 
example: 
1. Create the objects you need 
2. Clear the window, and get it to draw a Bitmap 
3. Refresh the window 
4. Play a sound effects 
5. Delay for a period of time 
6. Clear and draw a different Bitmap 
7. Refresh the window 
8. Delay again 
Feel free to download and use images and sound effects you can get from the Internet. It is probably 
best to work with png files for images, and ogg or wav files for sound effects. You could find an 
interesting xkcd and break it up into its cells, drawing them one at a time with some associated sound 
effects. 
What you show is up to you, but please avoid anything that may be offensive to others in any way. 
Note: 
Remember to create this as a new program. Once you have it setup in the terminal 
you can use skm resources to create the resource folders where you need to 
add the images and sound effects you want to use. 
It would be great if you could share what you come up with to the discussion board. If you are game, 
capture a screencast of your program running and post it up to YouTube or other video sharing service. 
Linux: There are a number of options for screencasts in Ubuntu and other distros. 
macOS: Use QuickTime Player to record screencasts. From the File menu choose New Screen 
Recording. 
Windows: Use the Game bar in Windows 10. 
We look forward to seeing what you have created!
